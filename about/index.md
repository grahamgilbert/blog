<p class="message">
  My name is Graham Gilbert, and I'm an engineer based in San Francisco, with an almost unhealthy interest in automation.
</p>

{% img float-right /images/Graham_Gilbert.jpg 300px %} I've been playing around with Macs for as long as I can remember, and I'm now in the fortunate position of being able to earn a living doing what I love.  I like [speaking]({{ root_url }}/talks) about automation, user experience and security related topics. I work on several open source [projects]({{ root_url }}/projects).

I currently work at [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) as a Systems Engineer, working primarily on their endpoint platform. Any views or opinions expressed on this site are my own and are not necessarily shared by my employer.

Everything on this site is mine, although feel free to link to anything I've written here and all of the code can be considered open source under the Apache license unless otherwise stated.
