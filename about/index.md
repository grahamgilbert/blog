My name is Graham Gilbert, and I'm a Mac admin based in London, with an almost unhealthy interest in automation.

I've been playing around with Macs for as long as I can remember, and I'm now in the fortunate position of being able to earn a living doing what I love.  I like [speaking]({{ root_url }}/talks) about Puppet, Munki, deploying Macs, and the intersection of the three. I currently work for a large multinational corporation managing their reasonably large number of Macs.

Everything on this site is mine, although feel free to link to anything I've written here and all of the code can be considered open source under the Apache license unless otherwise stated.
