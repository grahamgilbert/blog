Imagr is a great tool when you're wanting to deploy machines quickly in your office. But sometimes you will want to deploy machines when you're in a smaller remote site, or a site where security concerns mean you can't have servers. Imagr is flexible enough to handle this, and with a little creativity, we can deploy at these sites as easily as we can at our offices with NetBoot.
