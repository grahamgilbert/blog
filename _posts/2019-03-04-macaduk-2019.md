[MacAD.UK](https://www.macad.uk/) is just a few weeks away, and I'm rather excited about the whole thing. I will be speaking on the [second day](https://www.macad.uk/event/macaduk-schedule-2019/#1548327287121-3bbace28-2402) about Practical CI/CD workflows for Mac Admins - a topic that I've wanted to speak about for quite some time. And of course I am hoping we will all be able to go for the now traditional curry one evening (I'm sure we can all agree, curry is the height of British cuisine).
