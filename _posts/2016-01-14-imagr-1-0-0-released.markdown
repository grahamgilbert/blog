It's been a lot of work, but I'm pleased to say that Imagr has grown up and as I now consider it to have everything I originally intended it to have, I'm calling this a 1.0.0 release. 

You can get hold of it on [GitHub](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr/releases/tag/1.0.0), and if you want to get started with it, there is a load of information on the [Wiki](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr/wiki).
