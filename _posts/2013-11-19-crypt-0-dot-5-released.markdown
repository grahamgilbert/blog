I just pushed up version 0.5 of Crypt - the [release details are over at GitHub](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt/releases/tag/0.5). This is the last version that will be compatibile with the current version of [Crypt-Server](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt-server) - which has also been updated to be compatible with Django 1.5.

This is fully tested (in my environment!) with Mavericks, so go forth and escrow FileVault keys.
