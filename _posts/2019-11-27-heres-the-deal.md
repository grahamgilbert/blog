{% img float-right /images/movember.jpg 400px %}Up until now Movember has been pretty light hearted - I’m guessing this is why a lot of you haven’t donated yet. Time for some numbers.

* Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men, with nearly 700,000 people getting it each year.

* There is a 50% chance that I will get testicular cancer again.

* If my cancer does come back, there is 5-10% chance it will kill me.

I'm not doing this for fun, or because I enjoy growing silly facial hair. Your donations are funding research that makes sure Lily still has a daddy.

To everyone who has donated so far: you’re lovely people, and when Lily is old enough to know what is happening, she will thank you (probably with a big drooly kiss).

Those who haven't: "liking" this, retweeting, whatever won’t stop cancer. Thoughts and prayers won't stop it either. Medical research will, and that needs funding. [Unless you are really unfortunate, you can all manage to donate a little to help stop men dying too young](https://graham.at/movember).
