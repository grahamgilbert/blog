If you attended my talk in Gothenburg today, thank you! The slides from my primary talk, "0 to Imagr-ing in 45 minutes" are [available here](/images/posts/2016-10-06/0 to Imagr-ing.pdf), and you can find the all of the [code I used on GitHub](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr_macsysadmin_2016). If for some reason you would like my slides on beer in London (or, VMware is slow at imaging a disk and I needed to fill time), you can [also get them here](/images/posts/2016-10-06/Beer in London.pdf).
