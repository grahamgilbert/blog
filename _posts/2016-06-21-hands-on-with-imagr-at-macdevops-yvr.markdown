Thanks to Mat and everyone else who put so much effort into [MacDevOps:YVR](http://www.macdevops.ca) - it's been awesome, and I can't wait to come back next year. [Here are my slides](/images/posts/2016-06-21/Imagr.pdf), and I'll slim down the handout for use in the real world where you don't have a room full of nerds hammering a single access point shortly and update this post.
