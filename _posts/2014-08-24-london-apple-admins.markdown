I'm delighted to say that the first (first meet that isn't "let's go to the pub and get drunk", anyway!) [London Apple Admins](http://www.londonappleadmins.org.uk) meetup is happening on the 3rd September at [The Red Herring in St Pauls](http://theredherring.co.uk/). I'd like to take all of the credit for organising it, but it was down to the hard work of [Ben Toms](http://macmule.com). The theme this time is "this is what I'm working on at the moment", so I'll be talking about my new favourite toy, [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

If you'll be in or around London on the 3rd September, [please get yourself a ticket](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/london-apple-admins-sept-2014-tickets-12545591201) (they're free) and come and have a beer or two whilst listening to some awesome talks by London based Mac Admins.
