My name is Graham Gilbert, and I'm an OS X consultant based in London.

I've been playing around with Macs for as long as I can remember, and I'm now in the fortunate position of being able to earn a living doing what I love. I've leant towards the deployment and management of OS X, but I'm equally happy up to my elbows in a Linux server.

Please feel free to link to anything I've written here and all of the code can be considered open source unless otherwise stated.
