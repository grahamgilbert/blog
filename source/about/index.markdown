My name is Graham Gilbert, and I'm a sysadmin based in London, with an almost unhealthy interest in automation.

I've been playing around with Macs for as long as I can remember, and I'm now in the fortunate position of being able to earn a living doing what I love. I've leant towards the deployment and management of OS X, but I'm equally happy standing up web servers with Puppet on Linux. I speak about Puppet, deploying Macs, and the combination of the two.

If you'd like me to speak at your conference, or if you think you've got the perfect role for me, please get in touch.

Please feel free to link to anything I've written here and all of the code can be considered open source unless otherwise stated.
