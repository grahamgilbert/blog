For those of you who attended my talk yesterday at PSU MacAdmins on Managing Macs with Puppet, here are are my [slides](/images/posts/2013-05-24/Managing_Macs_with_Puppet.pdf) and all of the code and servers used are up on [grahamgilbert/puppet_psu_2013 on GitHub](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/puppet_psu_2013). Please comment, [email me](/about) or catch me on the [twitter](http://twitter.com/grahamgilbert) if you have any questions about any of this. Hopefully the video will be up soon, so those of you who weren't there to laugh at the guy with the funny accent can see me dealing with internet fails and my obscure British sit-com references.
