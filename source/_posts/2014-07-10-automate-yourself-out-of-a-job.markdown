A massive thanks to everyone who came to my talk today, and thanks to everyone who helped out with the Q&A at the end. All of the code I used in the talk is [up on GitHub](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/automate_psu_2014) and [here are the slides](http://grahamgilbert.com/images/posts/2014-07-10/Automate_yourself_out_of_a_job.pdf). Hopefully the video will convey how much fun it actually was - it could have been a disaster, so I'm hugely grateful to everyone who contributed to the discussion at the end.
