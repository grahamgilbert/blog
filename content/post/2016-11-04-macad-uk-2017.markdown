I'm delighted to announce that the lovely people at Amsys have asked me to return to speak at [MacAD.UK 2017](http://www.macad.uk/) for it's second year. This year I will be talking about [Airbnb's transition from a commercial macOS management platform to an entirely open source stack](http://www.macad.uk/speaker/speaker-graham-gilbert/) - *"Something something commercial, something something open source"*.

See you all in February!
