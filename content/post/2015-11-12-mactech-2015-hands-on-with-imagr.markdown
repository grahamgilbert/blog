title: 'MacTech 2015: Hands on with Imagr'
---

Last week, I led a lab in which participants got hands on with [Imagr](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr). I will hopefully be able to distribute the materials I used (the disk image is nearly 2GB, so I need to find a way of it not bankrupting me!), but in the meantime, [here are the slides](/images/posts/2015-11-12/ImagrLab.pdf). Thanks to everyone who attended, I hope you had as much fun as I did.
