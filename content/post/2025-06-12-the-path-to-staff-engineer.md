This morning I spoke at [MacDevOps:YVR](https://mdoyvr.com/) on the topic of Staff Engineering. Than you to everyone who came, and a huge thank you to Mat, JD, and the rest of the MDO team for putting on such an amazing conference. Here are the [slides](/images/posts/2025-06-12/the_path_to_staff_engineer.pdf) and the resources I shared during the talk.
