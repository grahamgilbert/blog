title: Five reasons sysadmins should use Git
---
This post could also be called "Things we could learn from our developer brethren, but I digress, to the list! (Lists are awesome, aren't they?)

I'm not going to try and tell you how to get started with Git ([go here instead for that](http://glarizza.posterous.com/using-git-for-mac-sysadmins-part-1)), I'm merely going to get on my soapbox.

1. **Branches** - need to test something? No need to spend all day making a test setup, just make a branch and clone it to the test server. If it turns out that I wasn't mad and my changes were a good idea, they can be merged back into the main branch just as easily.
2. **Accountability** - who made that strange config change? A quick look at the commit history is all you need.
3. **Diff** - what actually changed? It's easy to see the exact changes
4. **Change history** - why was that random change even made? Hopefully it's in the commit message! (Your commit messages are useful, aren't they?!)
5. **You can be a nice sysadmin** - if you use GitHub it's simple to take your repo public and share your awesomeness.

So there you go - I hope this goes some way to answering the question "why shuold I be using Git?"
