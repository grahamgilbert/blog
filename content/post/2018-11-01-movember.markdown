Earlier this year I was diagnosed with testicular cancer. I'm one of the lucky ones, I caught it early, was fortunate enough to have excellent treatment and am now in remission. Testicular cancer is the most common form of cancer in men under 40 years old - chances are either you will get it or you will know someone who will.

This year, I'm raising money for Movember. I've already raised an amazing amount mostly due to the generosity of the Apple admin community. I've had to raise my target several times until I went big and set it at \$10,000. I blasted though that before November even started, so thank you to everyone who donated!

If you haven't donated yet, and also think testicular cancer is a bit shit, please find your way to donating either on the [Movember site proper](https://graham.at/movember) or on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/donate/2170305706568894/?fundraiser_source=external_url) (who will very kindly eat the currency conversion fees if you don't want to donate in USD).
