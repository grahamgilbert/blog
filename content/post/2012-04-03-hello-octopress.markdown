title: Hello Octopress
---

Inspired by some of the [cool kids](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/), I've spent the last couple of evenings migrating my blog over to [Octopress](http://octopress.org). The main motivators were my desire to put my posts under version control (we've been going a bit nuts for Git at Pebble towers recently), and that I wanted to use the excellent Byword app to compose my posts (I just need to work out how I'm going to be able to use the iOS app to publish on the go - probably some Dropbox trickery).

Plus, using Ruby scripts and Rsync to publish the blog really appealed to my (not so) inner geek.

Anyway, normal mac-type sysadmin-y posts will resume shortly.
