For one reason or another, I may need to stay out of the US for a bit this year, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to be giving any talks - no siree!

In June, I'm going to be heading over to Vancouver for [MacDevOps:YVR](http://www.macdevops.ca/) where I will be leading a workshop that will take you through getting started with Imagr, and I will also be sitting on a panel that is focusing on configuration management.

Then in October, I'll be in Gothenburg for my first time at [MacSysAdmin](macsysadmin.se). This time I'll be taking a different slant on Imagr - rather than looking at how you can get started, I'm going to stand up production quality services in 45 minutes.

I'm rather excited about visiting these two conferences for the first time, and I hope I'll see some new faces as well as some old friends.
