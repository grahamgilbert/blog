title: Introducing Imagr
---
For the past few weeks, I've been working with some other Mac admins on a new application that can aid with the deployment of Macs - say hi to [Imagr](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr).

{{< figure src="/images/posts/2015-05-08/Imagr.png" >}}

It's not intended to be a full replacement for Deploystudio, but it's now got all of the features I need to use Imagr full time. If you'd like to get started with Imagr, head on over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr/wiki/Getting-Started) - the only requirement is a web server, so the barrier to entry is pretty low (if you followed my guide on how to set up [BSDPy](/blog/2015/04/22/getting-started-with-bsdpy-on-docker/), you can use that web server).

I hope you'll give it a go and maybe, just maybe, we can get rid of those little Mac Minis for good!
