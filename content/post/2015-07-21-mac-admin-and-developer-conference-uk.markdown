title: Mac Admin &amp; Developer Conference UK
---

I'm very happy to announce that [I will be speaking](http://www.macad.uk/speaker/graham-gilbert/) at the first [Mac Admin &amp; Developer Conference UK](http://www.macad.uk/), held in our very own London on February 9th and 10th, 2016. In addition to some [fantastic speakers](http://www.macad.uk/speakers/) (I have no idea how they let me in), it's being [sponsored](http://www.macad.uk/sponsor/london-apple-admins/) by [London Apple Admins](http://www.londonappleadmins.org.uk/) (who will be meeting next in early September - we are looking for people who would like to give a short 15-20 minute presentation - get in touch if you're interested).
