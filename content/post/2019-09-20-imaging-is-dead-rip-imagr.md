title: Imaging is dead (RIP Imagr)
---

When I [released Imagr](https://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2015/05/08/introducing-imagr/) back in 2015, it was a different time. We didn't have T2 Macs, NetBoot was still around and DEP was just something most of us scoffed at using.

In 2019, things have changed. MDM is no longer optional. DEP is the only automated method to deploy modern macOS devices. The NetBoot ship has well and truly sailed. No devices have been "imaged" in my organization for around two years.

So, it is with a heavy heart, that I'm going to retire Imagr. I will no longer update the code (indeed, the last contribution was over a year ago). Unless someone contacts me and wishes to continue maintaining it, it will stay in it's archived state.
