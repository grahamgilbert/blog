I'm pleased to announce that [Imagr 1.1.1 is out](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr/releases/tag/1.1.1)! Why am I so happy? This is the first release that's made up nearly all of community contributions. So many thanks to everyone who has helped out with code, documentation and filing bugs.

And if you're going to be at [MacDevOps:YVR](http://www.macdevops.ca/) in a few weeks, we'll be taking a look at how to use some of these new features.

Find out more about this [release over on GitHub](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr/releases/tag/1.1.1).
