Last week, I gave my first conference talk in over three years - and it was about what took up most of my 2022 - deploying phishing resistant MFA. Thank you to the organizers of [MacAD.UK](https://macad.uk/), the other speakers and all of the attendees for making it a great event. [My slides are available](/images/posts/2023-05-30/gonephishing.pdf) , and I will update this post when the video is published.
