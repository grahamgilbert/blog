This week, I travelled to beautiful Gothenburg to speak at [MacSysAdmin](https://www.macsysadmin.se/). Thank you to Patrik and the rest of the team for being such great hosts, and to all my friends, new and old, who made it such a fantastic week. 

[My slides are available](/images/posts/2023-10-06/Zero-Tust-is-not-Zero-Effort.pdf), and I will link to the video once it has been published.
