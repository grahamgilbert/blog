title = "A pragmatic approach to endpoint security at MacSysAdmin"

A few months back an email popped into my inbox from Patrik Jerneheim asking me if I would like to record a talk for this year's MacSysAdmin - it took me all of three seconds to reply with "of course!".

I've been wanting to give this talk for a long time, and it's really the product of several years working in close partnership with our security teams. [The video can be found at the MacSysAdmin site](https://docs.macsysadmin.se/2021/video/Day2Session1.mp4).
