I've been playing around with Macs for as long as I can remember, and I'm now in the fortunate position of being able to earn a living doing what I love. I like speaking about automation, user experience and security related topics. I work on several open source [projects](/projects).

I work at [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) as a Senior Systems Architect, working primarily on their endpoint platform. Any views or opinions expressed on this site are my own and are not necessarily shared by my employer.

Everything on this site is mine, although feel free to link to anything I've written here and all of the code can be considered open source under the Apache license unless otherwise stated.
